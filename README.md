Trivia Game

# Project Overview
This project is a trivia game based on the hit TV Series Beverly Hills, 90210. The show was near and dear to my heart during my teenage years (and, let's be honest - it is still in my top ten...).

Questions are displayed one at a time with a set time to answer.  When the user starts the game, they are presented with a multiple choice question. The choices are presented as buttons.  The correct answer is displayed after the user's guess or if the time runs out.  When the game ends, the user sees the total number for each of the following: correct answers, incorrect answers and any missed questions. 

The game utilizes jquery, bootstrap and javascript.
